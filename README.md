# Konami Code

This is a JQuery plugin to put a hidden code keycode on any website. The default is the classic Konami code for video games made by Konami--most notable, Contra and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turltles. (gotta' love old school games!)

## Supported Codes
* Konami: up, up, down, down, left, right, b, a, <enter>

### Roadmap
* Add support for options to be passed in for custom configuration.
* Add the Capcom Street Fighter II code as a possible default.
* Add a mode/utility that will record any series of keystrokes to make it easier for less technical people to customize this feature for their site
